# Snake Game Project

This is a simple Snake Game project implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to control a snake on a grid and eat food to grow longer. The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the game board or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Responsive design with a grid-based game board.
- Snake movement controlled using arrow keys.
- Food spawns at random positions on the game board.
- Score tracking and maximum score persistence using local storage.
- Game over condition with option to restart the game.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Provides the structure and layout for the game board and elements.
- CSS3: Styles the game board, snake, and food elements.
- JavaScript: Implements the game logic and interaction.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
- index.html        // Main HTML file for the game
- style.css         // CSS file for styling the game
- script.js         // JavaScript file for game logic
- README.md         // Project documentation
```

## Usage

To play the Snake Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
4. Eat the food by moving the snake's head to the food's position.
5. Avoid colliding with the boundaries of the game board or the snake's own body.
6. The score is displayed on the screen, and the maximum score achieved is stored in the browser's local storage.
